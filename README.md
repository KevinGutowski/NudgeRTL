This plugin, _Nudge RTL_, is used quickly resize the width a layer through easy keyboard shortcuts. It's similar to using <kbd>⌘ cmd </kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> or <kbd>⌘ cmd </kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> but pinned from the right side of an object.

## Usage

<kbd>^ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>←</kbd> = Expand layer size horizontally

<kbd>^ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>⌘ Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd> = Shrink layer size horizontally

**Note: Add <kbd>⇧ Shift</kbd> to increase the nudge size**

The amount the layer resizes by is based on the user's nudge size:

- default = 1
- default large (shift) = 10

This means that if you change your settings, it will respect this preference.

## Why make this plugin?

Occassionaly, I wanted the ease of being able to nudge shapes into place with the ease that <kbd>⌘ cmd </kbd> + <kbd>→</kbd>. Perhaps this is useful for people who design with right-to-left languages. Lastly, I wanted to practice plugin development. Feel free to reach out to me if you are just getting started!
