This plugin, _Nudge RTL_, is used quickly resize the width a layer through easy keyboard shortcuts. It's similar to using <kbd>‚åò cmd </kbd> + <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> or <kbd>‚åò cmd </kbd> + <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> but pinned from the right side of an object.

## Usage

<kbd>^ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> = Expand layer size horizontally

<kbd>^ Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> = Shrink layer size horizontally

**Note: Add <kbd>‚áß Shift</kbd> to increase the nudge size**

The amount the layer resizes by is based on the user's nudge size:

- default = 1
- default large (shift) = 10

This means that if you change your settings, it will respect this preference.
